## A. Jean-Paul Sartre

Jean-Paul Sartre's existentialist philosophy provides a profound exploration of masks and identity, emphasizing the inherent tension between an individual's authentic self and the roles they assume in society. Sartre's concepts of "being-for-itself" (être-pour-soi) and "being-for-others" (être-pour-autrui) are central to understanding his views on how masks shape human existence.

In *Being and Nothingness*, Sartre introduces the idea that individuals exist in a state of "being-for-itself," where they are conscious beings capable of self-reflection and self-definition. However, this self-awareness is constantly influenced by the presence of others, leading to the state of "being-for-others." Sartre argues that in social interactions, individuals often wear masks to conform to the expectations and judgments of others, which can lead to a form of self-deception known as "bad faith" (mauvaise foi). He writes, “There are two kinds of beings: those who are what they are, and those who are not what they are” (Sartre, 1984). This distinction highlights the conflict between living authentically and adopting masks to fit societal roles.

Sartre's notion of "bad faith" is a critical aspect of his philosophy. It refers to the act of lying to oneself to escape the anxiety and responsibility that comes with true freedom. By adopting masks and playing roles dictated by society, individuals often deny their own freedom and potential for authentic existence. Sartre explains, “Bad faith seeks to flee the in-itself by means of the false claim to be an in-itself” (Sartre, 1984). This self-deception allows individuals to avoid confronting the unsettling reality of their freedom and the responsibility that accompanies it.

One of the most illustrative examples of Sartre's concept of masks can be found in his play *No Exit* (*Huis Clos*). The play portrays three characters trapped in a room together, where they are forced to confront their true selves and the roles they have played in life. The famous line, "Hell is other people" (L'enfer, c'est les autres), encapsulates the idea that the gaze of others can trap individuals in a particular identity or mask, making it difficult to escape and be true to oneself (Sartre, 1989).

Sartre's exploration of masks extends to his analysis of freedom and responsibility. He argues that true freedom involves recognizing and embracing the fluidity of identity, rather than being confined by fixed roles or masks. In *Existentialism is a Humanism*, Sartre asserts that existence precedes essence, meaning that individuals are not defined by any pre-existing essence or role but are free to create their own identity through their actions and choices (Sartre, 2007). This radical freedom, however, comes with the burden of responsibility, as individuals must constantly choose and define who they are, without relying on masks or external definitions.

Furthermore, Sartre's concept of the "look" (le regard) is essential to understanding how masks function in social interactions. He posits that when we are aware of being looked at by another, we become an object in their world, and this objectification can influence how we perceive ourselves and the masks we wear. The "look" can force us into specific roles, making it challenging to maintain an authentic self in the presence of others (Sartre, 1984).

In conclusion, Jean-Paul Sartre's existentialist philosophy offers a profound examination of masks and identity. His concepts of "being-for-itself" and "being-for-others," along with the notions of bad faith, freedom, and the "look," provide valuable insights into the complexities of selfhood and authenticity. Sartre's work underscores the tension between societal roles and personal authenticity, emphasizing the importance of embracing freedom and responsibility in the ongoing project of self-creation.
