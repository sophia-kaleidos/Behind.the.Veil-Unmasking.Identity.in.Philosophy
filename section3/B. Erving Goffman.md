# B. Erving Goffman

Erving Goffman, a prominent sociologist, provides a unique perspective on masks and identity 
through his dramaturgical approach to social interaction. In his seminal work, *The Presentation 
of Self in Everyday Life*, Goffman explores how individuals present themselves in social 
contexts, likening social interaction to a theatrical performance where individuals are actors 
on a stage.

Goffman argues that in everyday life, individuals perform roles much like actors in a play, 
using masks to manage the impressions they make on others. He introduces the concept of the 
"front stage" and "back stage" to describe how individuals manage their self-presentation. 
The "front stage" is where the performance is given, and the individual wears a mask to conform
to social expectations and norms. In contrast, the "back stage" is where individuals can retreat
from their social performances and be their true selves, away from the scrutinizing gaze of 
others (Goffman, 1956).

One of Goffman's key insights is the notion of "impression management," which refers to the 
strategies individuals use to control how they are perceived by others. He writes, “When an 
individual plays a part, he implicitly requests his observers to take seriously the impression 
that is fostered before them” (Goffman, 1956). This highlights the deliberate and often strategic 
nature of self-presentation, where masks are used to shape social interactions and outcomes.

Goffman’s work also emphasizes the collaborative nature of social performance. He notes that 
social interactions are co-constructed, with both the performer and the audience playing active 
roles in maintaining the performance. The success of a social performance depends not only on the 
individual's ability to present themselves effectively but also on the audience's willingness to 
accept and support the presented identity. This interplay suggests that masks are not solely personal 
artifacts but are also influenced and sustained by social dynamics.

Furthermore, Goffman explores the concept of "role distance," which refers to the degree of separation 
an individual feels from the role they are performing. He observes that individuals often maintain 
a certain distance from their roles, indicating that they are aware of the difference between their 
true selves and the masks they wear. This role distance allows individuals to navigate multiple social 
contexts without becoming entirely defined by any single role (Goffman, 1956).

Goffman’s analysis extends to the potential consequences of failing to manage impressions effectively. 
He discusses how "spoiled identities" can arise when an individual's performance is discredited, leading 
to social stigma and marginalization. In his work *Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity*, 
Goffman examines how individuals with stigmatized identities use masks and strategies to navigate social 
interactions and manage their spoiled identities (Goffman, 1963). This underscores the importance of masks 
in both protecting and negotiating identity within social structures.

In conclusion, Erving Goffman's dramaturgical approach provides valuable insights into the role of masks 
in social interaction and identity formation. His concepts of impression management, front stage and back 
stage, role distance, and stigma highlight the complexities of self-presentation and the strategic use of
masks in everyday life. Goffman's work underscores the idea that masks are essential tools for navigating 
the social world, shaping both how we see ourselves and how we are perceived by others.
