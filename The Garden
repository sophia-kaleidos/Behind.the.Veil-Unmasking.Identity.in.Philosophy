# Future Identities

It seems that we may offer up our masks, but some we cannot obscure some of the basic identities. 
Some of these identities we can see in the form of the way our voice sounds, your height, your mentality.
Many of these properties of a being remain identity forming, and as of currently we have not had ways to
mask these identities. 

The internet has helped in masking a lot of these identities, but we have yet to bring that type of masking
to the sensual world. While one can alter their voice, alter your height through various shoes and procedures, and
change your mentality as it changes naturally over time, we have yet to discover how to bring it closer to
the biological. Also, we could consider various altering procedures to handle any of this identity change, but
would not a simulated representation work just the same?

For some things we would think not. For example, we cannot really change our size to that of an atom, but
we can simulate the experience, both on the observer and the observed. 

Perhaps we cannot change some aspects of our identity, others will become more fluid and easier to replace.
For example, voice modulation would allow for someone to choose the voice they want to represent them. 
Would it prove so strange as to want to speak with a low baritone when one has a high pitched voice, or
a cartoonish voice instead of a deep and gruff one.

## Profession

If automation and ai become more prevelant, would identities become extensions of oneself? If we wanted to 
have the identity of a world class chef, could we spin up a small ai company to make us as good as any
other and use it as an extension of ourselves? Would it involve, subscribing to other chef companies in
order to craft a unique and nuanced experience? Could we claim to "be" a chef? What does it mean to "be" any profession?

It, in some ways, may tie into the talk about thoughtforms, but it seems a complex concept. If I "am" a chef, does that mean:

1. I exist in a group called chefs (set)
2. I represent one of the members of the set
3. Other chefs represent the set but don't represent me

In some nebulous way, one would create the mask that represents "chef" and wear and shape that identity. This is similar
to any company role. A role tends to work a bit different than something like a professional identity, but they share 
concepts. A role acts as more of a temporary mask, whereas a profession acts as another layer to that, something more
"permanent" and active.

Some of this mask wearing takes part in a transformation from pretending to tendency. When gaining habits, through
play and imitation, we can gain the repetition and biological memory to make those tendencies more of a habitus. These
masks can then act as temporary identities, that either will meld with the rest of the masks, or will assimilate more
into the identity.
