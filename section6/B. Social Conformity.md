## B. Social Conformity

The theme of social conformity examines how masks facilitate the alignment of individual behavior with societal norms and expectations. This theme explores the ways in which individuals adopt masks to fit into social structures, the consequences of such conformity, and the balance between social integration and personal authenticity.

### How Masks Maintain Social Order

Masks play a crucial role in maintaining social order by allowing individuals to navigate the expectations and norms of their social environments. By adopting masks, individuals can conform to the roles and behaviors that are deemed acceptable by society, thus facilitating smooth social interactions and integration.

Erving Goffman's dramaturgical approach in *The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life* illustrates how individuals perform roles much like actors on a stage, using masks to manage the impressions they make on others. Goffman writes, “When an individual plays a part, he implicitly requests his observers to take seriously the impression that is fostered before them” (Goffman, 1956). This highlights the strategic use of masks in managing social interactions and maintaining social order. By adhering to expected roles and behaviors, individuals contribute to the stability and predictability of social life.

Friedrich Nietzsche also addresses the role of masks in social conformity. In *Beyond Good and Evil*, he explores how societal norms and moralities impose masks on individuals, compelling them to conform to established values and behaviors. Nietzsche argues that this conformity often stifles individuality and creativity, leading to a homogenized society where true self-expression is suppressed. He writes, “Every society has the tendency to reduce its members to a common denominator” (Nietzsche, 1966). This critique underscores the tension between the need for social order and the desire for personal authenticity.

#### The Consequences of Social Conformity on Individual Identity

While masks facilitate social conformity, they can also have significant consequences for individual identity. The pressure to conform can lead to a loss of individuality, as individuals suppress their true selves to fit into societal molds. This suppression can result in feelings of alienation, inauthenticity, and existential despair.

Jean-Paul Sartre's concept of "bad faith" in *Being and Nothingness* explores how individuals deceive themselves by adopting masks to avoid the anxiety and responsibility of true freedom. Sartre argues that by conforming to societal expectations, individuals deny their own freedom and potential for authentic existence. He writes, “Bad faith seeks to flee the in-itself by means of the false claim to be an in-itself” (Sartre, 1984). This self-deception highlights the existential cost of social conformity, where individuals lose touch with their true identities.

Carl Jung's analysis of the persona in *The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious* further elaborates on the consequences of social conformity. Jung warns that over-identification with the persona, the social mask, can lead to a fragmented sense of self and psychological distress. He writes, “The danger is that they become identical with their personas—the professor with his textbook, the tenor with his voice. One could say, with a little exaggeration, that they are utterly unconscious of themselves as distinct from their personas” (Jung, 1969). This highlights the potential for masks to create a false sense of identity, disconnecting individuals from their true selves.

#### Conclusion

The theme of social conformity reveals the dual role of masks in facilitating social order and contributing to individual alienation. Philosophers like Goffman, Nietzsche, Sartre, and Jung provide valuable insights into the complexities of social conformity, highlighting the balance individuals must navigate between fitting into societal structures and maintaining personal authenticity. Their works underscore the importance of recognizing the impact of masks on identity and striving for a balance that allows for both social integration and genuine self-expression.
