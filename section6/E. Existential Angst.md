## E. Existential Angst

The theme of existential angst explores the inner conflict that arises from wearing masks and the psychological and existential implications of living behind them. This theme delves into the anxiety and despair associated with the tension between one's true self and the personas adopted to navigate societal expectations.

### The Inner Conflict from Wearing Masks

Existential angst, a concept rooted in existentialist philosophy, refers to the profound sense of anxiety and dread that arises from the awareness of one's freedom and responsibility in shaping their own identity. This angst is often exacerbated by the masks individuals wear to conform to societal norms, which can lead to a disconnection from their authentic selves.

Søren Kierkegaard, in *The Sickness Unto Death*, discusses the concept of despair as a fundamental aspect of the human condition. He argues that despair arises when individuals fail to become their true selves, often due to the pressure to conform to external expectations. Kierkegaard writes, “Despair is the sickness unto death in the sense that it is an internal condition of the self” (Kierkegaard, 1980). This despair is frequently masked by the roles individuals play, leading to a profound sense of inauthenticity and existential angst.

Jean-Paul Sartre's existentialist philosophy further explores the inner conflict associated with wearing masks. In *Being and Nothingness*, Sartre introduces the concept of "bad faith" (mauvaise foi), which describes the act of lying to oneself to escape the anxiety and responsibility that comes with true freedom. By adopting masks and playing roles dictated by society, individuals often deceive themselves, leading to a sense of inauthenticity and existential dread. Sartre explains, “Bad faith seeks to flee the in-itself by means of the false claim to be an in-itself” (Sartre, 1984). This self-deception underscores the existential cost of wearing masks, where individuals lose touch with their true identities and experience a deep-seated angst.

### Kierkegaard and Sartre on Existential Angst

Both Kierkegaard and Sartre provide valuable insights into the nature of existential angst and its relationship to masks and identity. Kierkegaard emphasizes the importance of confronting despair and striving for an authentic self. In *Fear and Trembling*, he examines the story of Abraham and the concept of the "knight of faith," who embodies absolute trust in God and a commitment to an authentic existence beyond social conventions (Kierkegaard, 1985). The knight of faith represents the ultimate shedding of masks, as he embraces a direct and unmediated relationship with the divine, thus overcoming existential angst.

Sartre, on the other hand, focuses on the individual's responsibility to create their own essence through choices and actions. In *Existentialism is a Humanism*, Sartre asserts that existence precedes essence, meaning that individuals are not defined by any pre-existing essence or role but are free to create their own identity through their actions. This radical freedom, however, comes with the burden of responsibility and the potential for existential angst. Sartre writes, “Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does” (Sartre, 2007). This statement highlights the existential burden of authenticity, where individuals must continually choose and define themselves without relying on external masks.

### Conclusion

The theme of existential angst reveals the profound inner conflict associated with wearing masks and the struggle for authenticity. Philosophers like Kierkegaard and Sartre provide deep insights into the nature of this angst, highlighting the tension between societal roles and true self-expression. Their works emphasize the importance of confronting existential angst and striving for an authentic existence, despite the challenges and anxieties that come with it. This exploration underscores the existential cost of wearing masks and the imperative of embracing one’s freedom and responsibility to achieve genuine selfhood.
